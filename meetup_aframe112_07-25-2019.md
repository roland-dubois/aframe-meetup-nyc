## Important considerations when you build your own VR space - How to make your space save & inclusive 1/2

- Be clear about the role of your space add a code of conduct
- Make sure that you’re actively moderating
- Private by design and default - You decide who has access
- Give users time to acclimate & get used to the space (lobby)

## Important considerations when you build your own VR space - How to make your space save & inclusive 2/2

- Give the user control over self representation and identity, do not assume! (non-human Avatars / robots)
- Access to the platform (at low cost, low-end hardware)
- Respect social norms, provide tools for boundaries (safe spaces)	
- To avoid cyberbullying make sure you give users control over knowing who is in the space, how people interact with each other (cultural norms)
